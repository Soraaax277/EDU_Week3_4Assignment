Defend your home base from waves of incoming flying and crawling enemies. You must survive with at least 1 HP remaining.

The Core Loop
Incoming Waves: Enemies spawn at two locations (Yellow for arching paths, Cyan for snake-like paths).
Autonomous Defense: Your Turrets (Fire, Shotgun, and Sniper) will automatically track and engage any enemy that enters their range.

Survival:
Each enemy that manages to reach the Target Location will deduct 1 HP from your life total.
You start with 20 HP.
Watch the HP Bar: If you take damage, the green bar drops instantly, and a yellow "ghost bar" will trail behind it.

Collection: When an enemy is destroyed, they drop a Gold Coin. These coins fly through the air toward your HUD, increasing your score.

Victory & Defeat
Win: Successfully destroy all enemies in the wave without your HP hitting zero.
Game Over: If your HP drops to 0, the game freezes and the Fail Screen appears.
Quick Restart: If you lose, simply press the 'R' key to reset the level and try a different turret setup or path configuration.

Key Controls
Movement: Use W, A, S, D to navigate the arena and view the action from different angles.
Restart: Press R on the Game Over screen to play again.
